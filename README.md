*  `pictures/` contains PNG images used in the game's UI
*  `resources/` contains colors palettes and "skins"
*  `rulesets/` contains rulesets (collections of values and modifiers that affect how the game is played)
*  `sprites/` contains PNG images and JSON metadata files
*  `src/` contains Aseprite files for the sprites found in `sprites`

## External dependencies

*  [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) (optional, needed for `export.sh`)
*  [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (optional, needed for `export.sh`)

## Regenerating sprites

The original Aseprite files for the sprites are found in `src`. The sprite PNG files and their JSON counterparts can be created with Aseprite's _Export Sprite Sheet_ option.
On systems with Bash, you can export multiple sprites at the same time by calling `export.sh` followed by one or more aseprite files from within the `src` folder.

For example, to regenerate `sprites/tiles/grass.png` and `sprites/tiles/grass.json`:

1. `cd src`
2. `./export.sh tiles/grass.ase`
