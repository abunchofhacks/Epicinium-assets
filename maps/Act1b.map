{"challenge":{"briefing":{"1":"Capture or occupy all enemy cities","description":"Unfortunately, the enemy knew they would lose the previous battle and emptied their city of any resource. However, we did manage to rescue some captured allies! These powerful riflemen are more durable than our militia. \nA rifleman's armor reduces their movement by 1 but it takes 2 hits to kill them. ","greeting":"Commander!","objective":"Remember that after every combat all units regain their full hit points! So if you want to take down an enemy rifleman, you might want to surround it with your own units and use their focus ability by right-clicking on them. Focus causes all allied troops around the enemy to attack it simultaniously, allowing groups of weaker units to take out even the sturdiest of foes!\n\nWe also found an enemy secret note in the city. It reads: \"hold the left mouse button to speed up animations\".","sendoff":"Good luck!"},"max_stars":1,"name":"Act1B"},"climateModifier":0.0,"cols":13,"editor-version":"1.1.0-rc3","playercount":2,"pool":"custom","raininess":0.0,"rows":9,"ruleset":"Act1b","treetypes":["poplar"]}
