{"challenge":{"briefing":{"1":"Capture, destroy or occupy all enemy cities","description":"The enemy has been driven back, we have almost claimed our whole island! Only a small peninsula is still theirs. In a desperate attempt to gain back some ground, they are preparing an assault! Protect this bridge at all costs! Since we have regained our airfields, we are able to field zeppelins in this battle. Their ability to drop gas might prove useful in a chokepoint. Gas kills all units in a tile, and even speads to adjacent tiles. ","greeting":"Commander!","objective":"Keep a close eye though, as zepplins are easy targets for sappers and tanks. Zeppelins also drop gas upon dying, so be sure to not position them above your own unit. Lastly, zeppelins can be brought down by enemy zeppelins flying into them. Their movement is very limited, so plan accordingly.","sendoff":"Good luck!"},"max_stars":1,"name":"Act2d"},"climateModifier":0.0,"cols":13,"editor-version":"1.0.10","playercount":2,"pool":"custom","raininess":0.0,"rows":9,"ruleset":"Act2d","treetypes":["poplar"]}
