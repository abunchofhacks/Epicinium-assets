{"challenge":{"briefing":{"1":"Capture, destroy or occupy all enemy cities","description":"We have captured back our industry! We can now create more industry from cities. Industry are able to create tanks, which cannot use gunfire but have the powerful shell ability. This shoots two bombs per tank at an adjacent tile, destroying units and buildings alike! Industry also generate 3 gold each turn, making them a suitable alternative to farms in these cold mountains. Beware though, as too much industry dries out the surrounding area, limiting power in the city.","greeting":"Commander!","objective":"These mountains are even colder than the previous, especially if the many industrial buildings in this area impact the climate! Next to slowing us down this cold weather might freeze our ground units. Chilled units are unable to use abilities or fire their guns in spring until they warm up by moving. \nOne last note: tanks are heavy and damage any ground they drive though, sometimes even buildings! Our cities are already limited in power in this snowy land, so be careful.","sendoff":"Good luck!"},"max_stars":1,"name":"Act2c"},"climateModifier":0.0,"cols":18,"editor-version":"1.1.0-rc3","playercount":2,"pool":"custom","raininess":0.0,"rows":9,"ruleset":"Act2c","treetypes":["poplar"]}
