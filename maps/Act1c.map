{"challenge":{"briefing":{"1":"Capture or occupy all enemy cities","description":"Taking those enemy cities has won us a valuable strategic position! Some of the enemy troops have fled into a nearby mountain range. If they reach their city at the end of this range, they might be able to regroup! We should prevent this from happening by routing them all, and capturing their city in the progress.","greeting":"Greetings, commander. ","objective":"However, some troops might be waiting to trap us in the canyon. If we pass by an enemy unit or run away from one, it will shoot at us. We can prevent this attack of opportunity by striking first! An attack of opportunity is also prevented if one of our own units is stationed on the tile! This allows us to bypass enemy units without any combat at all. They also have units that hide in the forests or trenches, which give shelter from gunfire. Our riflemen can also make trenches, use them wisely!\n","sendoff":"Good luck!"},"max_stars":1,"name":"Act1c"},"climateModifier":0.0,"cols":12,"editor-version":"1.1.0-rc3","playercount":2,"pool":"custom","raininess":0.0,"rows":11,"ruleset":"Act1c","treetypes":["spruce"]}
